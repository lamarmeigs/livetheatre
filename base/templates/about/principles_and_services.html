<h3>Principles</h3>

<h5><strong>CTX Live Theatre is a proprietary, non-commercial and non-profit service.</strong></h5>
<p>It's an avocation â€” or maybe no more than a hobby, bordering on a quiet obsession.  Like philately.  Many people collect, classify and scrupulously preserve postage stamps; I collect and document theatre performances.  I've written more than 500 reviews and I've documented thousands of stagings of live theatre.  CTX Live Theatre does this at no charge to local artists and non-commercial productions.</p>

<h5><strong>CTX Live Theatre follows live narrative theatre produced in Central Texas.</strong></h5>
<p>'Narrative' means the presentation of a story via the interpretation of a set text. So, no improv, even though that art form can be thrilling, comic and suspenseful. Very little dance. Almost no stand-up solo gigs. And only very rarely any coverage of those touring productions that stop through the Bass Concert Hall and Long Center in Austin or the Tobin Center in San Antonio.</p>

<h5><strong>CTX Live Theatre aims to cover all sorts of live narrative theatre all over Central Texas.</strong></h5>
<p>Theatrical art is community engaged in shared imagination, factors present in virtually any gathering where the audience has agreed to watch the performance of a work. Performances at <strong>commercial venues</strong> such as the Zach Theatre are almost always worthy of critical consideration and applause &mdash; as, equally, are those of <strong>'community' theatres</strong> such as the HCCT in Cottonwood Shores, the Sam Bass Theatre in Round Rock, Playhouse Smithville, and VLA Theatre in Killeen.  Theatre departments at <strong>universities, colleges and schools</strong> inspire young persons and those who watch them.  Even more exciting are those very many <strong>groups of friends and acquaintances</strong> who come together to engage us with the art. Some are well-established and autonomous such as the Rude Mechs and the Hyde Park Theatre in Austin or the Attic Rep and the Classic Theatre in San Antonio; others are sporadic, tentative or devoted to a particular genre, artistic credo or set of beliefs.</p>
